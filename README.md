## Abstract and Project Description (Assignment 2)
**Pixel Coliseum** is a web-based 2D cooperative survival game where players battle waves of AI-controlled enemies in a fast-paced arena environment. Developed using Phaser 3, TypeScript, Node.js, Colyseus, and PostgreSQL, the project demonstrates real-time multiplayer networking, artificial intelligence, and database integration within a browser-accessible platform. Players can team up online, collect power-ups and various weapons, and compete for high survival scores across multiple rounds. The system tracks player performance, stores persistent statistics, and includes in-game chat functionality. The project highlights full-stack development, networking, and AI design while emphasizing scalability, interactivity, and engaging gameplay through modern web technologies.

### Core Gameplay
Players must survive as many waves as possible, using skill, teamwork, and quick reflexes.  
Enemies become progressively stronger and increase in number each round, and power-ups or weapon pickups will appear randomly throughout the arena to use strategically and help players survive longer.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Online Co-op:** Multiple players can connect and survive waves together using web-based multiplayer.
- **Enemy Waves:** Increasingly difficult rounds of AI-controlled enemies that challenge player coordination.
- **Combat System:** Players can move, attack, and dodge to survive against hordes of enemies.
- **Power-ups and Weapon Pickups:** Randomly spawning items and weapons that enhance combat or provide temporary boosts.
- **Scoring and Leaderboards:** Tracks player kills, best wave reached, and total score across sessions.
- **Persistent Player Stats:** Player progress and performance data stored in a database.
- **In-Game Chat:** Enables players to communicate during matches.

### Technical Overview
The project will be developed using:
- **Frontend:** TypeScript with Phaser 3 for gameplay and rendering.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Colyseus for multiplayer networking.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing player stats and match history.

## Budget
I have not spent any money on this project yet and I have not received any donations. However, I do plan on purchasing Aseprite for $19.99 with my own money, which will be a useful pixel art editing tool for my sprite creation process.

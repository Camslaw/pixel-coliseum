## Project Topic Area
The project will focus on **web-based game development**.

**Pixel Coliseum** is a top-down 2D **round-based survival game** playable directly in the browser.  
Players will enter an arena and fight off waves of AI-controlled enemies, either solo or cooperatively online.

### Core Gameplay
Players must survive as many waves as possible, using skill, teamwork, and quick reflexes.  
Enemies become progressively stronger each round, and power-ups or weapon pickups will appear throughout the arena to use strategically and help players survive longer.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Online Co-op:** Multiple players can connect and survive waves together using web-based multiplayer.
- **Enemy Waves:** Increasingly difficult rounds of AI-controlled enemies that challenge player coordination.
- **Combat System:** Players can move, attack, and dodge to survive against hordes of enemies.
- **Power-ups and Weapon Pickups:** Randomly spawning items and weapons that enhance combat or provide temporary boosts.
- **Scoring and Leaderboards:** Tracks player kills, best wave reached, and total score across sessions.
- **Persistent Player Stats:** Player progress and performance data stored in a database.
- **In-Game Chat:** Enables players to communicate during matches.

### Technical Overview
The project will be developed using:
- **Frontend:** TypeScript with Phaser 3 for gameplay and rendering.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Colyseus for multiplayer networking.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for storing player stats and match history.

### Objective
The goal of *Pixel Coliseum* is to deliver a browser-based survival game that demonstrates advanced topics in **web development, networking, AI behavior, and database persistence**.

## Tasks

1. **Research** requirements and best practices for browser-based multiplayer games using Phaser 3 and Colyseus.

2. **Design** the overall project architecture to integrate the frontend client, realtime game server, AI module, database layer, and PostgreSQL database.

3. **Develop** the Frontend Client input handler to capture player actions via keyboard and mouse.

4. **Implement** the Frontend Client network client to connect with the realtime game server over WebSockets.

5. **Develop** the Frontend Client renderer to display the arena, player characters, HUD, and chat interface.

6. **Design and implement** the Realtime Game Server game loop/tick system to advance gameplay at a fixed timestep.

7. **Implement** the Realtime Game Server gameplay logic to process inputs, resolve collisions, and determine outcomes.

8. **Develop** the Realtime Game Server chat relay to manage player messages during matches.

9. **Implement** the Realtime Game Server room/session manager to handle player connections and match lifecycle.

10. **Design and implement** the AI Module perception, decision logic, and action emitter to provide intelligent bot opponents.

11. **Develop** the Database Layer match result writer to persist match outcomes and statistics.

12. **Implement** the Database Layer player profile service to retrieve player information.

13. **Implement** the Database Layer leaderboard service to display rankings.

14. **Configure** the Database Layer DB access component (ORM) to interact with PostgreSQL.

15. **Design and create** PostgreSQL tables for players, matches, match_players, leaderboards, and optional chat logs.

16. **Implement** the Metrics Output system to track tick times, round trip latency, and player/room information.

17. **Test** the frontend and server integration to ensure smooth gameplay and synchronization under realistic latency.

18. **Test** AI Module performance to validate that bots behave correctly and provide meaningful challenge.

19. **Test** database persistence to ensure player stats and leaderboards are updated and retrieved correctly.

20. **Document** the system design, setup instructions, and usage guidelines in the project repository.

21. **Refine** the user interface for clarity and usability based on playtesting feedback.

22. **Validate** the system as a whole to ensure all modules integrate correctly and the game matches project goals.

## Notes
- Tasks were derived from the modules and subsystems in the design diagrams.  
- Since this is a solo project, all responsibilities belong to Cameron Estridge.  
- The task list covers research, design, development, testing, and documentation activities.

## Project Sought
My professional experience has been strongest with **C++**, which is also the language I enjoy most. I would prefer to work on a capstone project involving **C++** or **C#**, but I am adaptable and can quickly learn and apply new programming languages and technologies. I am seeking a project with a solid scope that will allow me to contribute meaningfully while achieving an excellent outcome for the course.
